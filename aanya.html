			<br> The Social Intervention is a an alternative resource that students can use during study breaks in the place of social media. Here, students have access to a 5-minute timer, which informs them of how much time they have left during a given break. Accompanying the timer is a guided, relaxation video that is simple and stimulating enough such that the child will be ready for their next block of studying. Although there is currently a guided video, future updates will include an unguided video.
